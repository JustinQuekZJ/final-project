# NYC Crime and Safety Tool

This is a repo of code for a simple interactive webmap that aims to serve as a crime and safety visualization dashboard/tool for NYC residents. 

As a police officer from Singapore, I wanted to try to build something related to law enforcement and public safety in the context of NYC, for my final project in my interactive webmapping class at NYU Wagner.

This tool allows officers to visualize different law enforcement-related statistics, such as police stops, major crimes, and 911 calls, on a precinctual level. The map's precinct fill layer has a stepped color gradient based on the value of each statistic to allow for comparative visualization between precincts.

Users can hover over each precinct to view the statistics via a tooltip, and can change the state of the map by clicking buttons to toggle among statistics.

A simple and fun webmap, enjoy interacting with it!
